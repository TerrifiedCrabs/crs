# CRS

CRS stands for "CSE Request System".

It's live at https://crs.cse.ust.hk/.

### Repository Structure

Utilizing [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the package manager and JS runtime, this repository is a monorepo[^1] [^2] that contains 3 packages of CRS, which essentially act as the Model, View, and Controller as in (some variation of) the [MVC architecture](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC).

- `packages/service` defines the Model.
- `packages/site` defines the View.
- `packages/server` defines the Controller.

To install dependencies for all three packages:

```bash
bun install
```

Then, configure the environment variables as specified in the `.env.example` files in the `site` and `server` packages. Copy the `.env.example` files to `.env` file (for `server` package) and `.env.local` file (for `site` package) respectively, and fill in the missing values. After that, begin the development with:

```bash
bun dev
```

### Tech Stack

The current plan is to preserve type-safety throughout the application by leveraging TypeScript and its powerful type system. In particular,

- The Model utilizes the type system in TypeScript and [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for preserving type safety, building JSON schema, and validating JSON information.
- The View mainly makes use of [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for building the beautiful server-side rendering site.
- The Controller uses [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) for creating type-safe APIs, and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for (type-safe and efficient) persistent data storage.
